ands in my name, to record its 
approval of the steps taken and
 to declare its confidence in t

that many preparations, such as
 have been indicated by my hon.
 Friend below the Gangway, have

that any of my friends and coll

uld say to the House, as I said
 to those who have joined this 
government: "I have nothing to 
offer but blood, toil, tears an
d sweat."We have before us an o
rdeal of the most grievous kind
. We have before us many, many 
long months of struggle and of 
suffering. You ask, what is our
 policy? I can say: It is to wa

the strength that God can give 
us; to wage war against a monst

rous tyranny, never surpassed i
n the dark, lamentable catalogu

olicy. You ask, what is our aim
? I can answer in one word: It 
is victory, victory at all cost
s, victory in spite of all terr
or, victory, however long and h
ard the road may be; for withou
t victory, there is no survival
. Let that be realised; no surv

We observe today not a victory

 renewal as well as change. For
 I have sworn before you and Al
mighty God the same solemn oath
 our forebears prescribed nearl

 the same revolutionary beliefs

of that first revolution. Let t
he word go forth from this time

That this House welcomes the fo
rmation of a Government represe
nting the united and inflexible
 resolve of the nation to prose
cute the war with Germany to a 
victorious conclusion.On Friday
 evening last I received His Ma
jesty's commission to form a ne
w Administration. It as the evi
dent wish and will of Parliamen
t and the nation that this shou
ld be conceived on the broadest
 possible basis and that it sho
uld include all parties, both t
hose who supported the late Gov
---------- BLOCK # 87 ---------
ernment and also the parties of
 the Opposition. I have complet
ed the most important part of t
his task. A War Cabinet has bee
n formed of five Members, repre
senting, with the Opposition Li
berals, the unity of the nation
. The three party Leaders have 
agreed to serve, either in the 
War Cabinet or in high executiv
e office. The three Fighting Se
rvices have been filled. It was
 necessary that this should be 
done in one single day, on acco
unt of the extreme urgency and 
---------- BLOCK # 88 ---------
rigour of events. A number of o
ther positions, key positions, 
were filled yesterday, and I am
 submitting a further list to H
is Majesty to-night. I hope to 
complete the appointment of the
 principal Ministers during to-
morrow. The appointment of the 
other Ministers usually takes a
 little longer, but I trust tha
t, when Parliament meets again,
 this part of my task will be c
ompleted, and that the administ
ration will be complete in all 
respects. I considered it in th
---------- BLOCK # 89 ---------
e public interest to suggest th
at the House should be summoned
 to meet today. Mr. Speaker agr
eed, and took the necessary ste
ps, in accordance with the powe
rs conferred upon him by the Re
solution of the House. At the e
nd of the proceedings today, th
e Adjournment of the House will
 be proposed until Tuesday, 21s
t May, with, of course, provisi
on for earlier meeting, if need
 be. The business to be conside
red during that week will be no

st opportunity. I now invite th
e House, by the Motion which st
ands in my name, to record its 
approval of the steps taken and
 to declare its confidence in t
he new Government.To form an Ad
ministration of this scale and 
complexity is a serious underta
king in itself, but it must be 
remembered that we are in the p
reliminary stage of one of the 
greatest battles in history, th
at we are in action at many oth
er points in Norway and in Holl
and, that we have to be prepare
---------- BLOCK # 91 ---------
d in the Mediterranean, that th
e air battle is continuous and 
that many preparations, such as
 have been indicated by my hon.
 Friend below the Gangway, have
 to be made here at home. In th
is crisis I hope I may be pardo
ned if I do not address the Hou
se at any length today. I hope 
that any of my friends and coll
eagues, or former colleagues, w
ho are affected by the politica
l reconstruction, will make all
owance, all allowance, for any 
lack of ceremony with which it 
---------- BLOCK # 92 ---------
has been necessary to act. I wo
uld say to the House, as I said
 to those who have joined this 
government: "I have nothing to 
offer but blood, toil, tears an
d sweat."We have before us an o
rdeal of the most grievous kind
. We have before us many, many 
long months of struggle and of 
suffering. You ask, what is our
 policy? I can say: It is to wa
ge war, by sea, land and air, w
ith all our might and with all 
the strength that God can give 
us; to wage war against a monst
---------- BLOCK # 93 ---------
rous tyranny, never surpassed i
n the dark, lamentable catalogu
e of human crime. That is our p
olicy. You ask, what is our aim
? I can answer in one word: It 
is victory, victory at all cost
s, victory in spite of all terr
or, victory, however long and h
ard the road may be; for withou
t victory, there is no survival
. Let that be realised; no surv
ival for the British Empire, no
 survival for all that the Brit
ish Empire has stood for, no su
rvival for the urge and impulse
